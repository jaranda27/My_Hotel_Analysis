# Key Observations from Data Analysis: Revenue, Parking, and Booking Trends in Two Hotel Types (2018-2020)
In this undertaking, we will examine a dataset encompassing information spanning from 2018 to 2020, focusing on reservation figures and attributes associated with two distinct hotel categories: country hotels and city hotels. Our objective is to derive valuable insights regarding revenues and trends, with the aim of addressing the subsequent inquiries:

- Which of the two hotel types has exhibited the most substantial growth over the past three years?
- Is there a need to augment the available car parking spaces?
- What are the predominant patterns evident within the dataset?

After conducting a thorough analysis, we may deduce that the total revenue of $8.0 million is equitably distributed between the two hotel types, showcasing a rather comparable growth rate for both categories. Furthermore, the percentage of required parking spaces has remained relatively consistent, ranging within 2-3% over the past three years. This suggests that no significant alterations are necessary to ensure a commendable level of service. Lastly, it is discernible that the average nightly rate has experienced a slight upturn, along with an increase in the overall number of nights reserved for both types of hotels.
